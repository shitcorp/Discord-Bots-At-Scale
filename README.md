# Discord Bots at Scale
Discord bots within recent times have undergone a number of upheavals. With the introduction of slash commands, to the [discontinuation  of discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1), so much has happened its hard to keep up to date with the latest information. This leads us into the purpose of this document, a well researched, more objective look into the ecosystem as a whole while also providing (necessary) commentary on the space from a humanistic perspective.

## Previous Iterations
This guide was initially written out of sheer dissatisfaction with the community. While more beginner focused guides existed like [discord.js's guide](https://discordjs.guide/), it seemed that nobody had really taken the time cater reliable advise for the more technically adapt members of the community. Now, some of you may point out the existence [Wolke's Microservice Bots paper](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/c9d7dfe6a78445011162a12abd32091d), and while I'll touch on it again later, I'll say now that it just simply advocates for using microservices, and nothing much more. To go back to my point about why I originally wrote this, I also felt that little was documented in the ways of best practices for each library, or what (usually awesome) optimization options where out there. This version of the paper won't focus as much on listing such options, unlike the previous version, but I'll be sure to include some link to, or a direct list within the repository in the future.
